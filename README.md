# My Top three places to visit in Istria Croatia

This is my second milestone project for CodeInstitute.
Project is about my top 3 places to visit in Istria - Croatia.

A live demo can be found [Here-My top 3 places to visit in Istria - Croatia](https://alenkrga.github.io/milestone02/)
 
## UX

The idea for this website was to create a simple and modern look, fully responsive for desktop
and smaller screens.


## Features

Sticky Navbar - accessible from anywhere on the website without having to scroll.

Navbar Hamburger - On smaller screens Navbar turns in to "hamburger". It's a three-line menu.

Carousel slider - a nice way to show images on the website.

Collapse card menu - a nice feature to hide/show fun facts on the website.

GoogleMaps with the responsive menu - made for the user to check one of my top three places on the map.

Send Email - EmailjS - functional email - user can send a question to the owner of the website.

FontAwesome - Added a few icons in FunFacts to make the website more interesting.

GoogleFonts - a website is using Raleway font.
